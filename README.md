# StratoSoar MK2
StratoSoar is an autonomous glider dropped from a high-altitude balloon. This balloon is launched by NEWBS and NeSciTech, and my project is part of a larger project called StratoScience. StratoScience is a group of teens who work together to make interesting science and engineering projects that fly 100,000 feet up into the sky.
