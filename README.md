### NOTE: This is a work in progress, and I warn you if you use my code or anything else here, stuff could go wrong. That being said, I hope you find some use out of this.

# StratoSoar MK2
StratoSoar is an autonomous glider dropped from a high-altitude balloon. This balloon is launched by NEWBS and NeSciTech, and my project is part of a larger project called StratoScience. StratoScience is a group of teens who work together to make interesting science and engineering projects that fly 80,000 feet up into the sky. 

# Goals
There are many goals for my project, but I'll outline some of the major ones:
1. To be able to fly in a uniform manner
2. To be able to steer the glider autonomously
3. To cleanly drop the glider from 75,000 feet
4. To keep the glider under 249g
5. To make the glider out of easily obtainable/cheap materials
6. To be able to collect environmental data from sensors and read that data
7. To make a super low-power flight controller based on Arduino
8. To be able to track the glider using LoRa and HAM radio

As far as potential uses, the list goes on and on:
1. Environmental monitoring
2. A reusable radiosonde
3. A reusable satellite (a motor and solar panel could be attached, leaving the glider flying around certain areas in times of emergency)
4. A moving mesh network node (for remote areas)
5. Aerial imagery (could be used to find sickened farmlands, etc.)
6. Small-scale deliveries in remote areas, such as blood or medicine
7. And of course, a spy drone

# Use
### NOTE: Currently, no GPS has been interfaced with the board. The board's location is static.


# Limitations
only pro mini 3.3v8mhz

# Funding
We currently have very limited funding to complete this project. We would love.
