There are a few different licenses here, so I put the licenses in their repsective folders.

NOTE: My media is unlicensed, meaning that it is copyright infringement to use my logo. Make your own logo. I cannot legally stop you from using the name StratoSoar, though I would prefer if you didn't steal my name and start a company. 

This may change in the future when this becomes a larger thing. I might make everything public domain so there could be StratoSoar kits, but right now I'm going to at least keep my logo safe when this is a small project. 

Again, I can't stop you from using the name StratoSoar. 

List of licenses:
